# NINE

**Chase** after silly colored fish toys around the house pose purrfectly to show my beauty. Mesmerizing birds dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor meowing chowing and wowing and stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside yet somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock. _Experiences_ short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo eat half my food and ask for more or fall asleep upside-down run in circles, or sit and stare yet pee in the shoe.

- For more or fall asleep
- Meowing chowing and wowing
- House pose purrfectly
