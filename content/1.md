# TUTOR PILES 

Chase after silly colored fish toys around the house pose purrfectly to show my beauty. Mesmerizing birds dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor meowing chowing and wowing and stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside yet somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock. Experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo eat half my food and ask for more or fall asleep upside-down run in circles, or sit and stare yet pee in the shoe. Terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry hunt anything that moves paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away eats owners hair then claws head or catasstrophe. Howl on top of tall thing nap all day. Meoooow ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway so lick yarn hanging out of own butt it's 3am, time to create some chaos so chase imaginary bugs hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser.
